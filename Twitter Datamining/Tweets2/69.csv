@SouthernMissFB @Coach_Hall7 tough loss. But um. The only thing ima question is your absolute egregious management of the QB room.

@THE1DAW @ayalaneftali3 No Alvarez. That’s big trouble for USM. I watched one game and he is a player you typically see on a Atlantic 10 or up east team. High IQ they really need him. If he is out for a long time that will probably be the end of Ladner. Hope I’m wrong but that’s what I see,1592353581176586241,2022-11-15T03:07:32.000Z,en,['1592353581176586241'],43326457
